# 🏦 Loan Approval Predictor

This project predicts whether a loan should be approved or not using a machine learning model called **Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC)**.

It’s built to help banks or loan officers make quick decisions based on user information like income, education, credit history, and more.
